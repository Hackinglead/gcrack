python gcrack.py  [file_with_hashes]

Inspired by BozoCrack that cracks MD5 hashes by googling for hashes and using the resultant query as a wordlist, i wrote this little script to do a similar thing, but with a few improvements:

1) Googles for hash, uses only plaintext data for possible wordlist candidates and hashing
2) Currently supports following hashes: md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512
3) Input file with hashes can be mixed with any type of above supported hashes
4) If the attack finds the hash, it will even ID the hash for you

Works suprisingly well if you have a large base of hashed passwords and you quickly need a
possible plaintext. The attack is a bit probabalistic because of googles results, so rerunning the script can yield more results. 

Future improvements/TODO:
1) Add wordlist generation from queries with specific keywords
2) Better spliting and mangling and joining rules.
